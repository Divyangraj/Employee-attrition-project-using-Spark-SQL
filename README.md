Employee attrition is a critical challenge faced by organizations across industries. As the backbone of any company, employees play a crucial role in driving 
the organizationâ€™s performance and success. However, when employees leave, it can have a significant impact on the organization in various ways:

### 1. High Costs: 
Recruiting and training new employees is expensive, both in terms of time and money. The process of hiring new talent, onboarding them, and bringing them up to
speed can strain resources.
### 2. Loss of Experience: 
When experienced employees leave, they take with them valuable knowledge and skills that are often hard to replace. This loss can disrupt ongoing projects and 
affect the overall efficiency of the team.
### 3. Reduced Productivity: 
Attrition can lead to a decrease in productivity, as remaining employees may be burdened with additional responsibilities while new hires are being trained.
### 4. Impact on Profitability:
The combined effects of high recruitment costs, loss of experience, and reduced productivity can directly impact the organization's profitability.


Given these challenges, it is essential for organizations to understand the factors contributing to employee attrition and implement strategies to retain valuable 
employees. This project utilizes **Databricks** and **Spark SQL** to analyze employee attrition, uncovering the key factors leading to employee turnover. 
By leveraging these technologies, the analysis aims to provide actionable insights that can help organizations improve employee retention, enhance productivity,
and drive better business outcomes.
